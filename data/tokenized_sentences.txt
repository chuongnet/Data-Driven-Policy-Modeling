obesity reported systematically kidney diseases mentioned less frequently data seem play stronger role especially among fatal cases
addition large number cases among younger people comparatively high proportion mild disease extensive testing strategy put place germany early precise detection played role high proportion mild cases
time strategy expanded include contact tracing outbreaks screening certain population groups mild asymptomatic cases covered national notification system
addition increased screening measures put place due high risk old people nursing homes could therefore treated promptly
short interval symptom onset hospital admission age group years older median two days would support assumption
total cases resulted hospitalisation among least one reported risk factor
results study first preliminary analysis disease severity shows proportion cases reported risk factors among hospitalised cases increased
course pandemic reporting sars cov2 cases notification software became easier increase could risk factor reporting
risk factors distributed age group
children adolescents young adults aged particular made small proportion hospitalisations frequently admitted hospital despite reported risk factor
important beginning pandemic hospitalisation recommended patients tested positive including therefore mild cases order ensure isolation would explain high proportion hospitalisations among younger groups beginning wave
time age group demonstrates longest median icu stay eleven days median total icu stay nine days
contrast shorter median stay icu identified among older cases could related higher proportion fatalities older age groups
possible differences results presented karagiannidis et al could involvement university hospitals latter study
university hospitals severe cases treat disproportionately often due therapeutic options provide replacement therapies turn cases due patents risk factors
would explain median stay hospital identified karagiannidis et al ten days compared eight days et al nine days present study
first study germany et al identified median seven days used study population cases include patients received intensive care
present analysis suggests median length stay icu nine days clearly tolksdorf et al five days
present analysis included larger percentage fatal cases calculation icu stay compared tolksdorf et
suggests critical cases present analysis due higher data completeness among critical cases cases icu fatal cases system whole see chapter
to59 age group hospitalised later average spent longest time intensive care
length time symptom onset hospital admission relevant clinical management
period longest among to59 age group six days median
contrast shorter median stay icu identified cases could related higher proportion fatalities older age groups
length icu stay calculated excluding fatal cases
among cases aged older duration increased median six days
contrast length stay among year days median group still longest stay icu
since interval symptom onset hospitalisation well length time spent intensive care longest age group possible risk severe cases age group faces underestimated cases admitted hospital later therefore severe stage
result may require longer periods hospitalisation intensive care due advanced stage disease
small number cases treated intensive care could considered mean analysis provide limited findings regard see limitations set
analysis primarily faces limitations associated surveillance data
line legal requirements cases usually recorded system documented within health care system resident doctors hospitals laboratories test centres additionally community facilities schools
accordingly people mild asymptomatic disease visit doctors test centres diagnosed thus notification system
addition severe cases likely lead doctor visit increases likelihood diagnosis among certain age groups increasing severity
mild asymptomatic cases whereas severe cases disproportionately
proportion mild cases consistent international experience numbers dependent recommended implemented testing strategy well testing capacities established beginning first wave surveillance system place including case fact analysis includes laboratory confirmed cases
assumed proportion mild cases present analysis comprehensive testing strategy conducted germany
comparison studies germany hospitalised cases well represented notification system cases requiring intensive care thus ventilation clearly
data tolksdorf et al karagiannidis et al suggest around around one third hospitalisations require intensive care whereas study found
similar picture emerges cases existing risk factors
data completeness risk factors among hospitalised cases actually seem well reported suggests general risk factors furthermore german
notification system provide distribution risk factors therefore provide research
addition high proportion fatal cases among cases treated icu suggests information icu stay better reported fatal cases cases long period hospitalisation notification system time
finally cases reported recorded difficult local health authorities follow gain information changes time report updated information afterwards
mean precise information disease severity particular delayed
information available usually available severe critical cases
first covid19 wave germany majority cases mild
high proportion severe cases correlation disease severity increasing age
data year olds particularly applies critical cases could indicate risk severe disease increases earlier previously thought
cardiovascular diseases diabetes neurological disorders reported relevant risk factors
due limitations surveillance data used possible determine risk factors disease severity
nevertheless analysis provides valuable information disease severity covid19 particularly affected groups

population increased risk severe covid19 germany
minority people test positive covid19 develop severe critical form disease
many risk factors old age pre existing conditions therefore focus protective measures
analyses presented based data german health update geda ehis carried nationwide cross sectional telephone based survey april october
definition increased risk severe covid19 primarily based age pre existing conditions
around million people germany increased risk developing severe covid19
million belong high risk group
average number people risk live alone
prevalence increased risk higher among middle aged men among women age highest proportion people increased risk live saarland eastern german federal states
pandemic important account fact half population aged increased risk severe illness
moreover regional risk burden taken account planning interventions
sars cov2 severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus coronavirus disease covid19 strong political social impact life decline new cases numbers began rise significantly october
second half november number deaths clearly exceeded level spring
disease burden death due covid19 level would normally expected lower respiratory infections period
men account almost two thirds years life lost covid19 people aged share
vaccines approved since end key avoiding infections severe illness
since number vaccines available limited future access vaccines needs regulated
particularly important vulnerable groups protected
priority groups covid19 vaccinations broadly fall two categories addition people deemed essential nursing staff often high risk others focus primarily placed people increased risk developing severe form disease vulnerable groups
data first covid19 wave demonstrates minority people covid19 infection developed severe illness
around people tested positive developed mild cases suffered complications pneumonia required inpatient intensive care died
classified severe critical forms disease
order reduce burden disease caused covid19 therefore makes sense people vaccine likely affected severe illness
majority people already reached advanced age certain pre existing conditions
means age distribution people increased risk particularly relevant planning vaccination programmes
existing evidence used clearly risk factors associated severe covid19
data demonstrate old age main risk factor hospitalisation death regardless pre existing conditions
evidence led standing committee vaccination recommend older old people prioritised covid19 vaccination
moreover many older people pre existing conditions risk factors

previously made size risk groups germany
based claims data people aok health insurance found million people risk using different definition
central institute statutory health insurance germany zi identified significantly lower prevalence among people results presented
studies included obesity important risk factor
furthermore old age accepted main risk factor developing severe covid19 included estimates population related parameter
higher number people risk germany study plausible
moreover european comparison found germany one highest population based risks severe form covid19
fact slightly women men appear risk attributed higher life
prevalence increased risk developing severe covid19 actually higher among middle aged men among women age
differences women men among factors thought explain higher level covid19 mortality among men
men become seriously ill covid19 frequently younger age likely women decade life
disease burden calculated years life lost significantly higher among men women
differences distribution increased risk developing severe covid19 education reflect literature socioeconomic health inequalities germany

international literature demonstrates people low socioeconomic status higher risk severe covid19
regional differences health well documented germany show example similar patterns diabetes high blood pressure asthma copd higher prevalence rates eastern german federal states saarland
telephone based surveys often associated limitation lower response rates compared face face surveys
necessarily lead higher level non response bias
addition sample weighting differences sample general population therefore associated extent

temporary change individual population groups participate telephone based surveys completely even though initial analyses compared suggest case
important pre existing conditions associated risk developing severe covid19 heart failure dementia cancer could included definition used article
sensitivity analyses demonstrated limitation little impact size risk groups
analyses presented therefore plausible
describe population need special protection addressed targeted measures priority necessary
contrast previous analyses based claims data geda ehis enables social increased risk clearly identified
future research involve depth analyses focus closely combinations social risk factors since sex age education household independently determine person risk developing severe covid19
clear risk severe covid19 distributed unequally across society
lower level education associated higher risk developing severe covid19 frequent sars cov2 vaccinations survey german institute economic research shows
target group specific approaches contain covid19 pandemic could therefore suitable covid19 interventions
furthermore differences disease burden covid19 sex indicate men increased risk even younger age constitute special target group particularly encouraged take vaccination
different risk burden found different regions could relevant allocating vaccine
important mind million people risk live alone
among individuals likely many million people need long term care general many elderly community people
proportion people could possibly reached using outreach measures invitation based procedures
